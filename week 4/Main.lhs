Functional Programming Assignment 1: Main
=========================================

Functions in this file are used to generate the tests used for
the lab. You're welcome to have a look around, but not expected
to understand what's going on in this corner of the world.

Main
----

Since we will be compiling this file into a binary file for execution,
it will include a `main` function as the entry point for the program,
and this file is also a `Main` module, which we declare as follows:

> module Main where

There are a number of library functions that we will be importing,
so we do that with the following statements:

> import Triangle
> import Data.Maybe
> import Control.Monad
> import System.Environment
> import Data.List

You don't need to know what these do at this point, other than that
they provide various functions that are used later on.

> main :: IO ()
> main = do
>   args <- getArgs
>   case args of
>     [] ->
>       do let (pass, fail) = (partition isNothing . map check) tests
>          putStrLn ("Tests")
>          putStrLn ("* Passed: " ++ (show . length) pass)
>          putStrLn ("* Failed: " ++ (show . length) fail)
>          when (length fail > 0)
>            (mapM_ (putStrLn . showFail . fromJust) fail)

>          putStrLn "Exercises"
>          mapM_ (putStrLn . verify) solutions

>     as:bs:cs:_ -> case parse as bs cs of
>       Nothing        -> putStrLn (show Impossible)
>       Just t  -> putStrLn (show (triangle t))
>     _         -> putStrLn "Triangle takes three arguments: ./Triangle 3 4 5"

> parse :: String -> String -> String -> Maybe Triple
> parse as bs cs = case (reads as, reads bs, reads cs) of
>   ([(a,"")],[(b,"")],[(c,"")]) -> Just (a, b, c)
>   _                            -> Nothing

> verify :: (String, Int, Int) -> String
> verify (exn, ex, sol) = "* " ++ exn ++
>   if (ex == sol)
>     then ": passes test"
>     else ": incorrect, expected " ++ show sol ++ " but got " ++ show ex

These are the solutions to the exercises where n = 1000.
Your final submission will be tested more rigorously.

> solutions :: [(String, Int, Int)]
> solutions = [("ex1 1000", ex1 1000, 231), ("ex2 1000", ex2 1000, 11675), ("ex3 1000", ex3 1000, 23085)]

> check :: (Triple, Triangle) -> Maybe (Triple, Triangle, Triangle)
> check (t, s)
>   | s /= s'   = Just (t, s, s')
>   | otherwise = Nothing
>   where s' = triangle t
>
> showFail :: (Triple, Triangle, Triangle) -> String
> showFail (t, s, s') = "Expected: " ++ show (t, s) ++ ", Actual: "  ++ show s'

These are the tests that get executed.
