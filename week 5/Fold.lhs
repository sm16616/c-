Folds
=====

This part of the assignment is concerned with defining folds.

You will need to create a file called `Fold.hs` where you will place
your answers.

In lectures we covered the `foldr` function:

< foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
< foldr f y []     = y
< foldr f y (x:xs) = f x (foldr f y xs)

It's worth cementing this type and definition in your mind: it's a
very useful function! Try to understand how it works, and make
sure you can come up with this definition from scratch by yourself.

The idea behind a `foldr` is relatively simple: it's a function
that replaces the *structure* of a list with an *evaluation* of
the list. For instance, let's consider a list of numbers,
and how it might be converted into the sum of its elements.
First, remember that we can write the list `[1,2,3,4,5]` as
`1 : 2 : 3 : 4 : 5 : []`. Let's call this list `xs` and see how we can
manipulate it:

    xs     = 1 : 2 : 3 : 4 : 5 : []
               ↓   ↓   ↓   ↓   ↓  ↓
    sum xs = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 +  0 =  15

Notice that summing this list involves replacing the symbol `:` with
`+`, and `[]` with `0`. The actual elements of the list remain
untouched. In other words, the essence of a `sum` operation
is the `+` and the `0`. This observation is captured in the following
definition of `sum`:

< sum :: [Integer] -> Integer
< sum = foldr (+) 0

Now let's try a different operation, the factorial function:

    xs     = 1 : 2 : 3 : 4 : 5 : []
               ↓   ↓   ↓   ↓   ↓  ↓
    fac xs = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 *  1 =  120

Again, we leave the elements untouched: we simply replace the
structure of the list with an evaluation. In this case,
we use `*` and `1`. So this gives us the following definition
of `fac`:


> fac :: Integer -> Integer
> fac n = foldr (*) 1 [1 .. n]

So how does the `foldr` function work?
Well, there are two cases for `foldr`: when the list is empty, and
when it is not. When the list is empty, we have:

< foldr f y [] = y

This is the code that replaces the empty list with the value `y`
that is passed in.

To replace the `:` operation, we look to the second case:

< foldr f y (x:xs) = f x (foldr f y xs)

This says that we use `f` and apply it to the incoming `x` as well
as the result of folding `xs`.

Now it's your turn to write some code that folds results.

To make things easier, I've moved all of the code that you should modify
into a single file called `Fold.lhs`. You should modify only that
file for the exercises of this assignment.


The following TODOs should all be implemented using `foldr`.
You should use `ghci` to check your implementations are well typed
and that they behave how you expect.

    $ ghci Fold.lhs

You should be using ghci extensively to test your work: type in
values to test your functions yourself.

**TODO #F1:** Define a function called `sum :: [Integer] -> Integer`
that sums a list of numbers.
For instance

    sum :: [Integer] -> Integer
    sum = foldr (+) 0
    sum [1, 2, 3, 4] = 10

**TODO #F2:** Define a function called
`product :: [Integer] -> Integer` that finds the product of a list of
numbers. For instance

**TODO #F3:** Define a function called `and :: [Bool] -> Bool` that
returns `True` when all the elements of the input list are `True` and
returns `False` otherwise.
For instance

    and :: [Bool] -> Bool
    and = foldr (&&) True
    and [True, False, True, True] = False
    and [True, True, True, True] = True

For instance

    all :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Bool
